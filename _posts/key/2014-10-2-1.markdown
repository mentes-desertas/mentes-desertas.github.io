This is the key.  
The mystery key.  
  
The key to what?  
I’m not  
quite sure.  
I wonder what  
this key is for?  
  
Let me see.....  
could it be:  
  
the key to the door  
of a treasure store?  
  
the key to a lid  
where things lie hid?  
  
a secret box  
with magic locks?  
  
the key to a cupboard,  
a closet, a drawer?  
  
I wonder what  
this key is for?  
  
When I find it  
I’ll unlock it,   
  
but meanwhile keep   
this key   
in my pocket.
