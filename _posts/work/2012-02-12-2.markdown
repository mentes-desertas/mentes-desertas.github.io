Hey, don’t say you love my work.  
I know where these discussions  
tend to go, and so do you:  
  
back to my place where we  
grill giraffe steaks, maybe  
open a Zimbabwean merlot.  

Then you, perched on a djembe  
drum, watch me wax my double-  
barreled elephant gun  
  
until it gleams like a bad symbol.     
Then some recorded swallow song,  
and the next day you’re gone.
