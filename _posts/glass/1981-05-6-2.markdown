I looked in the mirror  
and liked what I saw.  
  
I thought, if I could bottle this,  
I would be a rich man.  
  
I did bottle it  
and set up a stand  
  
in front of my house.  
A dwarf walked up.  
  
“How much?”  
he asked.  
  
I turned my face away from him.  
“You could never afford it.”  
  
“Oh yeah?”  
he raised his eyebrows.  
  
“Three dollars,”  
I said.  
   
He shook his head  
and walked away.
