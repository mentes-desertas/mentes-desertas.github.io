the goldfish sing all night with guitars,  
and the whores go down with the stars,  
the whores go down with the stars  
  
I'm sorry, sir, we close at 4:30,  
besides yr mother's neck is dirty,  
and the whores go down with the etc.,  
the whrs. go dn. with the etc.  
  
I'm sorry jack you can't come back,  
I've fallen in love with another sap,  
3/4 Italian and 1/2 Jap,  
and the whores go  
the whores go  
etc.
