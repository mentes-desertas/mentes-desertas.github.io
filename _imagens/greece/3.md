title: "Where Fluted Columns Originated. The Temple of Jupiter near the Acropolis at Athens, the original fluted column structure, and the pattern of which is now used for all first class bank buildings, lamp posts and courthouses back in America. Before this magnificent ruin there was established the first ARC relief station in Athens, where thousands of Greek sufferers from the war were cared for. Below it is the Red Cross hospital where Greek girls are learning modern nursing methods under American instruction. America came to Greece for its architecture and in return has taught Greece better standards of living"
