title: "American nurses bring far more than hospital skill to the wounded American soldiers in France. They speak their language, not English merely but American, understand their slang, know what they like to hear read, and when the American Red Cross Nurse and the American soldier begin talking about home, home means the same kind of a place and the same kind of folks to both. This natural sympathy is particularly important in treating cases of shell shock, the nervous result of battle, where the most perfect understanding between nurse and patient is essential. Surgeon General Gorgas has called upon the Red Cross to enroll for the Army Nurse Corps, 8,000 graduate nurses by Oct. 1st"
