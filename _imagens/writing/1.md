title: "[Portrait of Sid Catlett, New York, N.Y., ca. Mar. 1947] â€” Caption from Down Beat: [from article] The shot of exuberant Sidney Catlett (who had just caught a flying drumstick) was taken during one of Louis Armstrong's last rehearsals before his Carnegie Hall concert. Can't report on Louis' recital since the Great One had not; at this writing, appeared. By the way, has it ever occurred to you, too, that Big Sid, whether at or away from his drums, gives an unsurpassed impression of tremendous physical power?"
year: 1947
